PokemonAI
=========

JS library for writing competitive Pokemon AIs


Just clone the repo into a folder and load that folder as an unpacked Chrome extension, then write your turn logic in ai.js's logic() function. 

When you load the page, it will automatically queue with a specified team (you can comment those lines in ai.js out to prevent that). Each turn, logic() will be called and should invoke a click to end the turn somehow (switching pokemans, using moves, etc).
